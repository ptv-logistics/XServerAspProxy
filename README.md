# XServerAspProxy
Relay a PTV xServer Request in your ASP.NET Middleware

This can be useful to access an xMapServer behind a firewall, allow cross-domain and cross-scheme calls, inject your credentials, add some load-balancing, fail-over, etc. The web-client can still use xServer in exactly same way as it does a direct access.
